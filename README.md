## ‚ú® Features

### üåà Multiple Color Models

All color models update in real-time as you adjust any slider, helping you understand how different color spaces relate to each other. Watch how adjusting HSL saturation affects HWB whiteness, or see how OKLCH's perceptual hue differs from HSL's mathematical hue. This live comparison makes it easy to understand when each color model works best.

- **OKLCH** - Wide gamut perceptual color space perfect for design systems. Access vibrant P3 display colors impossible in sRGB
- **HWB** - Intuitive whiteness and blackness mixing. Natural for adding white or black to pure hues
- **HSL** - Classic hue, saturation, and luminosity. Familiar and intuitive for quick color selection
- **HSV** - Hue, saturation, and value (brightness). Popular in graphics software, great for artists
- **RGB** - Direct red, green, blue channel control with alpha transparency
- **HEX** - Web standard supporting 3, 4, 6, and 8 character codes (with alpha support)

### üéØ Smart Color Handling

- **Cross-format pasting** - Paste any color format into any input field
- **Auto-model detection** - Automatically enables the appropriate color picker
- **Precision preservation** - OKLCH colors maintain full precision without sRGB conversion
- **Gamut visualization** - See P3 vs sRGB differences with dual color swatches

## üöÄ Technology

Built with modern web technologies:

- **TypeScript & React** - Type-safe, reactive UI
