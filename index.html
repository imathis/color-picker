          <h3>HSL, HWB &amp; HSV: Hue</h3>
          <p>
            In <abbr title="Hue, Saturation, Luminosity">HSL</abbr>,
            <abbr title="Hue, Whiteness, Blackness">HWB</abbr>, and
            <abbr title="Hue, Saturation, Value">HSV</abbr>
            we can describe and manipulate colors in a very natural way. The hue
            property ranges from 0 to 360 letting us select our base color. For
            example, red shows up at 0, yellow at 60, and orange naturally
            resides between them at 30 degrees.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the HSL model, a pure red is at <code>hsl(0 100% 50%)</code>.
            In HWB however, a pure red is <code>hwb(0 0% 0%)</code>, and in HSV
            it's <code>hsv(0 100% 100%)</code>. Read on to
            learn the differences between these three models.
          </p>
          <h3>HSL: Saturation &amp; Luminosity</h3>
          <p>
            Saturation is a percentage that describes the amount of hue in our
            color. Starting with our pure red at
            <code>hsl(0 100% 50%)</code>, as we reduce the saturation our color
            will become more and more gray. At 0% saturation the hue will not be
            evident in the color at all, leaving us with a grayscale spectrum.
            At 100% we will have the full brilliance of the hue available to our
            color mix.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luminosity is a percentage which allows us to tweak the amount of
            white or black added to our color mix. Again, given our pure red
            <code>hsl(0 100% 50%)</code>, our luminosity is at 50%. As we reduce
            the luminosity our color darkens until it becomes black at 0%. As
            you would expect, when we increase the luminosity our red becomes
            pink and eventually white at 100% luminosity.
          </p>
          <h3>HWB: Whiteness &amp; Blackness</h3>
          <p>
            Whiteness, as you'd expect, lightens a color as you increase it from
            0% to 100%. And as it would follow Blackness adds black to your
            color. A color with 0% blackness and 100% whiteness will always be
            white. As you increase the blackness, the color will become more
            gray. Let's look at our pure red again. In HWB it is
            <code>hwb(0 0% 0%)</code>. If we want to make it more pink, we need
            to add whiteness. If we want to desaturate it a bit we can add some
            blackness too, which will make it appear more of a smokey pink.
          </p>
          <h3>HSV: Saturation &amp; Value</h3>
          <p>
            <abbr title="Hue, Saturation, Value">HSV</abbr> (also called HSB for 
            Brightness) shares the same hue wheel as HSL and HWB. However, saturation 
            and value work differently. In HSV, our pure red is 
            <code>hsv(0 100% 100%)</code>. Saturation controls color intensity just 
            like in HSL, but value controls brightness from black (0%) to the pure 
            hue (100%). Unlike HSL's luminosity, HSV's value never adds white to 
            your colorâ€”it only controls how bright or dark it appears.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where HWB lets you independently add whiteness and blackness to a pure hue, 
            HSV takes a different approach. You can desaturate toward gray (like HSL) 
            or darken toward black with value, but there's no direct way to lighten 
            toward white. This makes HSV particularly intuitive for artists familiar 
            with traditional color mixing, where you start with a pure pigment and 
            either dilute it or darken it.
          </p>
          <h3>Which to use?</h3>
          <p>
            HSL came first to the web, rescuing us from the misery of picking
            colors in HEX (#c0ff33 anyone?) or RGB. HSL was instantly a better
            choice and lead me to create this website to help people understand
            how HSL worked. However, if you've spent much time using graphics
            applications you may be familiar with HSV (also called HSB). While
            HSV isn't supported in CSS, HWB's approach of independently controlling
            whiteness and blackness makes it a natural choice for those comfortable
            with HSV workflows. With excellent browser support you will be fine
            with either HSL or HWB.
          </p>
          <h3>WAIT A MINUTE, Eight Character Hex Colors???</h3>
          <p>
            Yea pretty neat huh? It turns out hex colors support alpha. You can
            even have four character hex colors. Just like <code>#F3A</code> is
            shorthand for <code>#FF33AA</code> so the color
            <code>#F3A0</code> is a transparent pink which expands to
            <code>#FF33AA00</code>.
